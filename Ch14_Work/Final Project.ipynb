    "One way to construct a maze starts with an n√ón grid such that each grid cell is bounded by four unit-length walls. We then remove two boundary unit-length  walls,  to represent  the  start  and  finish. For each  remaining unit-length wall not on the boundary, we assign a random value and create a graph G, called the dual, such that each grid cell is a vertex in G and there is an edge joining the vertices for two cells if and only if the cells share a common wall. The weight of each edge is the weight of the corresponding wall. We construct the maze by finding a minimum spanning tree T for G and removing all the walls corresponding  to edges in T.\n",

    "Write a program that uses this algorithm to generate mazes and thensolves them. Minimally, your program should draw the maze and, ideally, it should visualize the solution as well."

An efficient implementation using a disjoint-set data structure can perform each union and find operation on two sets in nearly constant amortized time, so the running time of this algorithm is essentially proportional to the number of walls available to the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "It matters little whether the list of walls is initially randomized or if a wall is randomly chosen from a nonrandom list, either way is just as easy to code.\n",
