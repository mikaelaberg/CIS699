    "One way to construct a maze starts with an n√ón grid such that each grid cell is bounded by four unit-length walls. We then remove two boundary unit-length  walls,  to represent  the  start  and  finish. For each  remaining unit-length wall not on the boundary, we assign a random value and create a graph G, called the dual, such that each grid cell is a vertex in G and there is an edge joining the vertices for two cells if and only if the cells share a common wall. The weight of each edge is the weight of the corresponding wall. We construct the maze by finding a minimum spanning tree T for G and removing all the walls corresponding  to edges in T.\n",

An efficient implementation using a disjoint-set data structure can perform each union and find operation on two sets in nearly constant amortized time, so the running time of this algorithm is essentially proportional to the number of walls available to the maze.\n",
