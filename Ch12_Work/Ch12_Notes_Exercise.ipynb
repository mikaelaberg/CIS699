    "In Python, the natural order of objects is typically1defined using the<operator having following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "• ***Irreflexive property:*** k/<k.\n",
    "\n",
    "• ***Transitive property:*** if k1 < k2 and k2 < k3,then k1 < k3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitive property is important as it allows us to infer the outcome of certaincomparisons without taking the time to perform those comparisons, thereby leadingto more efficient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In  this  chapter,  we  present  four  other  sorting  algorithms,  called ***merge-sort***, ***quick-sort***, ***bucket-sort***, and ***radix-sort***, and then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various algorithms in Section 12.5. \n",

    "\n",
    "We will first describe the merge-sort algorithm at a high level, without focusing onwhether the data is an array-based (Python) list or a linked list; we will soon giveconcrete implementations for each. To sort a sequenceSwithnelements using thethree divide-and-conquer steps, the merge-sort algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Divide:*** If S has zero or one element, return S immediately; it is already sorted. Otherwise (S has  at  least  two elements), remove all the  elements from S and put them into two sequences, S1 and S2, each containing about half of the elements of S; that is, S1 contains the first n/2 elements of S,and S2 contains the remaining n/2 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Conquer:*** Recursively sort sequences S1 and S2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Combine:*** Put back the elements intoSby merging the sorted sequences S1 and S2 into a sorted sequence.\n",
